## Introduction
Sorting is a process of ordering or placing a list of elements from a collection in some kind of order. It is nothing but storage of data in sorted order. Sorting can be done in ascending and descending order. It arranges the data in a sequence to make operations on data easier.The day to day example of sorting is dictionary (searching word in dictionary in alphabetical order.)Sorting technique depends on the situation. It depends on two parameters.

1. Execution time of program that means time taken for execution of program.
2. Space that means space taken by the program.

Sorting techniques are differentiated by their efficiency and space requirements.

There are different sorting algorithms what they do is take lists of items as input data, perform specific operations on those lists and deliver ordered data.

Sorting can be performed using several techniques: 

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Heap Sort


Here we have three among them bubble sort,quick sort,selection sort.
